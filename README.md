# **About App**

As truthly travel-lovers, we (4 developers) decided to create an App, which will offer travellers everything in one place. 

This is a **RESTful** Single Page Web application, a graduation project, which was created in 6 Sprints (we used to work in SCRUM; 
our Sprints were lasting for 1 week). 

# **What do we offer?**

Accio Vacaccio offers services as:

 - representing informations about chosen city in real time (**API** were chosen as a solution);

 - forum, which gives ability to as for some help or find info about another user's experience;

 - adding to followings and having chat with app users;

 - storing photos in cloud (**AWS S3 bucket**);

 - storing some useful for travellers datas (**AWS RDS**).

 
Nice to see you interested in **Accio Vacaccio**.

1. You tried to run an App and appeared Error "Cannot configure hibernate EntityManager configuration" =>

   We can fix it! The cause it appeared is AWS accout expired and we should restore it.
2. You chose a city and some info didn't render and in console appeared message with "HTTP code 429" => 

   It means, that given amount of requests already used.
   There a two possible couses: 
    - Expired amount of requests per day for some API;
    - Expired amount of requests at all for some API and we will be needed to change an account.

# **Guideline**

There are two ways of doing things in the app:
- ``` When the user is logged in```;
- ``` When the user is not logged in```.

**NOT LOGGED IN** user has limited access to the application's functionality. 

Such a user can **ONLY READ** the forum 
 ![forum](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89380230/187661042-24d1b7cd-0f62-4cae-ba4a-57aea9d876d1.jpg)
and can use the main functionality of the application - search for information about the city.

**LOGGED IN** user has full access to the functionality of the application.

1. For such a user, all of the standard functions on the forum are open (add/delete/edit/like/sort, etc.).
